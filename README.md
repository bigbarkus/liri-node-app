# liri-node-app

Welcome to Liri, Siri's less useful cousin. Liri is a command line input app that takes command inputs + information queries to provide accompanying information relevant to user input regarding movies, songs, or artists.

Enter any of these intuitive commands for more information on whatever you input:

 * `concert-this '<artist name here>'`

 * `spotify-this-song '<song name here>'`

 * `movie-this '<movie name here>'`

 * `do-what-it-says` (takes from random.txt, executing the first complete line it reads)

And with the free utility graciously granted by Spotify and IMDB, corresponding information will follow any of your commands.
Concert-this provides venue, date, and location of any (living) touring artist. Spotify-this-song gives the artist, album, and spotify link to the song. Movie-this queries plot to actors to rating, etc. Do-what-it-says will read from any saved line of text from the random.txt file which can be edited.
